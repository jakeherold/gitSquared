      We, the developers of Git Squared, want to tell you a story.
      <br>
      <br>
      Years and years ago, we were just like you. We were fresh-faced computer enthusiasts, who just wanted to find a cool hobby, or get a new job. So, we enrolled in a code school. We completed all of the work to get into the school, and arrived on day one feeling ready for anything.
      <br>      <!-- <div id="vidDiv">

      </div> -->
      <br>
      <br>
      How wrong we were
      <br>
      <br>
      Once at school, we found that the tools to code quickly and effectively could be just as difficult as the coding itself. We struggled through learning the basics of terminal, slack (actually, that one was pretty easy), and most terrifying of all.....GIT!
      <br>
      <br>
      Now, don't get us wrong. We love git, now. Its one of the most effective tools for verstion control and working in a large group thats out there. That said, its also a total bugger to really wrap your head around. At the end of our first class at the aforementioned code school, we decided to help all those who struggled with Git. To git the world to be a more friendly place, for those of us who don't git it.
      <br>
      <br>

      So, it is with hopeful hearts that we present you with this website. Its not the most comprehensive. It doesn't have the biggest budget. But! We struck out to balance the information you need, while keeping it as simple as possible.
      <br>
      <br>
      Best of luck to you!
      -Jess, Alex, Connor, and Jake
