For general philosophy on Git for this projects, please refer to the feature branch workflow model in the article following.
 https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/centralized-workflow/

For all contributors utilizing this repo, our rules and methodologies are as follows:
0. Fork our group's master repository onto your account.
1. Clone a local copy to work on.
2. Make a new branch for *any* new feature.
3. When new feature is complete, then (and only then!) merge branch into YOUR master.
Note:  Master branches always contain a working script. No buggy//broken//useless master updates. TIFU: a round of breakfast burritos.
4. Rinse and repeat until all needed features are implimented.
5. To update GROUP master:
  a. get a code review from whole group
  b. merge the kickass new feature in.
6. Repeat 1-5 until we pass the class.

Random rules:
+Describe commits in excruciating detail, and generally commit at *working* feature implementation
